                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>TechHive is a 10 week long internship program at UC Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science. During the internship you will build a museum exhibit with museum staff and 24 other high school students from the East Bay.
                    You will spend the first few weeks of tech hive learning the basics of programming, electronics and physical prototyping. No previous technical experience is needed! We make interactive exhibits, events and classes that teach the public about science and technology. In the internship program, high school students work alongside museum staff to create projects for the museum and our community partners. During the program, interns will be trained through hands-on workshops.

                    <br>

                    <br>They will learn about:<br>Computer programming and electronics<br>Physical prototyping and mechanical design<br>How to document projects using photographs, video and online portfolios<br>

                    
                    <br>
                    The TechHive is modeled after industry internships, where teens apprentice under experienced staff from the museum. Interns are expected to conduct themselves professionally, but being creative and having fun are part of the job! Each intern will leave TechHive with work experience, a design project for their portfolio, lots of new skills and lots of new friends.
